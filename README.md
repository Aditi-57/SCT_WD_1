Project: Responsive Landing Page with Interactive Navigation

Overview: As part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology, I developed a responsive landing page designed to provide a seamless user experience across various devices. The project involved creating an engaging and visually appealing layout, ensuring that the page is fully responsive, and implementing an interactive navigation menu for easy access to different sections of the page.

Key Features:

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensured consistent performance and appearance across multiple browsers by testing and optimizing the page for compatibility.
Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Tailwind CSS (optional if used)
